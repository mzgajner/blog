<em>JavaScript on TV - Building full screen apps with Vue.js</em> was a talk I gave at two different meetups - one in [Maribor](https://www.meetup.com/MariborJS/events/243679848/) and another in [Ljubljana](https://www.meetup.com/Ljubljana-JavaScript-User-Group/events/244270257/). It focused on my work for United.Cloud where we developed Vue.js based web app targeted for use on Smart TVs. I presented some less known platform details, went through specific issues that were encountered during development and tried to assess the usefulness of the framework for this particular use case.
