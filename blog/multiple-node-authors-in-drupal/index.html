      <p>While working on the current website of <a href="//www.radiostudent.si">Radio Študent</a>, I wanted a node to have multiple authors, because many of the published articles were collaborations of multiple writers. I presumed Drupal would support this out of the box, since it seems like a relatively common situation, but it didn't. So here's how you can do it manually.</p>
<h3>Step 1 - Content type modifications</h3>
<ol>
<li>Add a <em>user reference field</em> allowing multiple values to the content type in question. <a href="//drupal.org/project/references">References module</a> is required for this.</li>
<li>Inform editors this field should be used to enter all additional authors besides themselves when publishing articles.</li>
<li>Edit node template or use <a href="http://drupal.org/project/ds">Display Suite</a> to customize node display and include your newly created field next to the primary author.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Step 2 - Profile page modifications</h3>
<p>Having references to all authors on the node is cool, but we also need to show all nodes of a single author on his profile page, whether he's the main author or just entered among additional authors in our new field.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a page view using <a href="https://drupal.org/project/views">Views</a> and call it <em>All nodes by user</em> or something similar.</li>
<li>Set the URL of the view to <em>/user/%</em> so that it will override default user profiles.</li>
<li>Install <a href="//drupal.org/node/357082">this patch</a> for Views to allow passing of values from contextual filters to regular filters.</li>
<li>Filter nodes that have user ID from URL in Author field <strong>or</strong> in Additional authors field you created earlier.</li>
</ol>
<p>I admit it's not the cleanest thing ever, especially with the patch requiring manual reapplication whenever Views are updated, but it seems to work well.</p>
<p>I was given a possible <a href="//stackoverflow.com/questions/11207011/authors-nodes-page-with-views#comment14745045_11207011">alternative solution</a> when I posted this problem on Stack Overflow. It sounds even more promising, though I didn't use it at the time, because I had issues with <a href="//drupal.org/project/rules">Rules</a> (ongoing problem since my childhood).</p>
