      <p>I have been working with Vue quite a lot since the beginning of 2016, both at work and on personal projects. I have to say I'm quite excited about it - it's easy to understand and you can become very productive with it in a very short time, so I was happy to prepare a short talk about it for a <a href="//www.meetup.com/Ljubljana-JavaScript-User-Group/events/234612147/">JavaScript meetup</a> in Ljubljana when the organizers invited me.</p>
<p>The talk was basically an overview of all the nice things you can get in the Vue.js ecosystem that aren't part of the core framework, but still mostly official and/or provided by the core team. Sadly, the talk wasn't recorded, but you can download the slides <a href="/slides/Mato%20%C5%BDgajner%20-%20Making%20small%20big%20again.pdf">here</a>.</p>
