      <p>Some of the things I do for fun.</p>
<p>&lt;hr&gt;</p>
<h2>Kozjansko geekali≈°ƒçe</h2>
<p>David ≈†arlah, a friend from primary school, reached out to me during the pandemic. I was kinda grumpy at first since I knew he was a recruiter and I thought he's just trying to hire me, but then we had a beer and decided to start a meetup.</p>
<p>That's how <em>Kozjansko geekali≈°ƒçe</em> was born. We're a bunch of devs and other IT workers from <a href="https://sl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kozjansko">Kozjansko and Obsotelje</a> who meet monthly in <a href="https://mladinskislatna.si/mc-slatna/">MC Slatna</a>. There's a <a href="https://geeki.zgajner.com">website</a> and <a href="/geekalisce-stickers.jpg">stickers</a>.</p>
<h2>Danes je nov dan</h2>
<p><em>Today is a new day</em> is a collective of activists focused on increasing political participation, transparency and public oversight - often with the help of digital technology. I've been hanging around since ~2016, occasionally volunteering to develop bits and pieces of various projects (from <a href="https://parlameter.si/">parliament tracking tools</a> to <a href="https://danesjenovdan.si/kura/">battery chicken simulations</a>).</p>
<p>There's a lot to cover, so check out <a href="https://danesjenovdan.si/">the website</a>.</p>
<h2>Radio ≈†tudent</h2>
<p>I passed the audition to become an announcer at this <a href="https://sl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_%C5%A0tudent_Ljubljana">infamous alternative station</a> in 2010 and actively worked in that role for a few years. Some of my favorite contributions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://old.radiostudent.si/categories.php?catid=325">Kuharski programi</a> <em>(Culinary programmes, 2011)</em> - We did four of these together with my friend and colleague Andra≈æ Magajna. The concept was to host a normal 4-hour live radio programme while cooking, each edition focused on a different culinary theme and included guests, cooking competitions and fake food-related news bits.</li>
<li><a href="https://radiostudent.si/dru%C5%BEba/dlakava-dlan">Dlakava Dlan</a> <em>(Hairy Palm, 2010 - 2015, <strong>seriously NSFW</strong> üçÜ)</em> - This morning feature ran weekly for 5 seasons  and covered different topics related to sexuality and pornography. It started as a joke, but grew immensely over the years. We somehow got a sex shop to sponsor us and did a bunch of fun things - from sex toy reviews and DVD giveaways to interviews and reports from local adult-themed events. Shoutout to Maco, ≈†u≈°ka, Tegla, Zala and Pia for their freaky contributions.</li>
<li><a href="https://radiostudent.si/dru%C5%BEba/pritiskavec">Pritiskavec</a> <em>(Joypad, 2015 - current)</em> - Another morning feature with a simple concept - every week we recommend an indie video game. Originally the brainchild of Rasto Pahor, I was on board by the third week and Domen Mohoriƒç joined in the second season. The idea later (2017) spawned a more serious spinoff called <a href="https://radiostudent.si/kultura/pritiskavec-gold">Pritiskavec Gold</a> - an hour-long monthly talk show where we cover various video game related topics. Both are still going strong.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you speak Slovene, there are full recordings and podcast feeds of all of the above available on the provided links.</p>
<h2>Oktet 9</h2>
<p>A small men's choir (well, an <a href="https://gph.is/1c3jSXd">a capella group</a>) we've had since high-school. Not much to say other than they're some of my closest friends ‚ù§Ô∏è. We have <a href="https://oktet9.com/">an outdated website</a> and <a href="https://oktet9.bandcamp.com/releases">a release on Bandcamp</a> no one ever bought.</p>
