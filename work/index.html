      <p>This is a short summary of the most important companies and projects in my professional career. If you are interested in working with me, I can generally be reached at <a href="mailto:work@zgajner.com">work@zgajner.com</a>, though I'm currently fully booked.</p>

<h2>Sleuth</h2>
<p><em>current</em></p>
<p>You can currently find me at <a href="https://www.sleuth.io">Sleuth</a>, a startup that went through a bunch of interesting products. We were initially building a developer tool to help teams deploy more often, then pivoted to a reporting platform for aligning engineering and business. In early 2026, we started approaching initial customers with <a href="https://skills.new/">Skills</a>, a tool that helps you manage AI tooling at scale.</p>
<p>Our toolkit mostly consists of Django on the backend and Vue with Nuxt on the frontend, I'm in a full-stack role with the emphasis on front-end.</p>
<h2>Reciprocity Inc.</h2>
<p><em>2017 - 2020</em></p>
<p>I joined <a href="https://reciprocitylabs.com/">Reciprocity</a> as a front-end contractor and eventually became one of the more senior team members. As the entire organization grew, I was able to take on many interesting responsibilities such as conducting technical interviews at various stages, coordinating the front-end guild and organizing hackathons. My last year with them, I had the pleasure of leading the Bergdoktor team that was responsible for internal platform development.</p>
<h2>United.Cloud</h2>
<p><em>2016 - 2017</em></p>
<p>At United.Cloud, I was involved in development of a smart TV app that was part of a new IPTV platform. It was a standard TV interface with features one would typically expect such as viewing live channels, browsing programme guides, streaming VoD content etc. Because it had to be multiplatform, we implemented it as a JavaScript app based on <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> with the addition of a few official modules. I was one of the most senior team members responsible for a lot of technical/architectural decisions. The application has been in production in the entire Balkans for a while under the <a href="https://eon.tv/">EON brand</a>.</p>
<h2>Celtra</h2>
<p><em>2015 - 2016</em></p>
<p>Celtra is a multinational company that specializes in mobile advertising. As a member of the Dashboard team I helped develop part of Celtra's AdCreator platform, an interactive analytics dashboard for ad management. Most of the application was written in CoffeeScript and based on Backbone with some parts in Vue.</p>
<h2>Astina (later Origammi)</h2>
<p><em>2013 - 2015</em></p>
<p>I spent two years at Astina (which became <a href="http://origammi.co">Origammi</a> after a merger), a Swiss-Slovenian software company. I worked as a front-end developer on the Ljubljana team, covering projects of various sizes, mostly built with Symfony2. My work consisted of design implementation (SASS, custom structure based on SMACSS, different frameworks depending on project requirements), RIA development (based on AngularJS), asset pipeline management (Grunt configurations) and occasional UX tasks (prototyping).</p>
<h2>Goclick</h2>
<p><em>2012 - 2013</em></p>
<p><a href="//goclick.si">Goclick</a> is a Slovenian web advertising company and one of the biggest Google AdWords resellers in Southeast Europe. They employed me as a web programmer with the intent to perform previously outsourced development in-house. The work mainly consisted of designing structure and implementing design for medium-sized websites. Software used varied depending on project and included Jekyll, Drupal, Ubercart and Shopify.</p>
<h2>Slidemotion</h2>
<p><em>2012</em></p>
<p><a href="//slidemotion.com">Slidemotion</a> was a startup that offered a service for simple automated creation of video slideshows from Facebook photo albums based on likes and comments. I developed the client-side of the web application that was the primary user interface for the service using jQuery and Facebook SDK for JavaScript.</p>
<h2>Radio Študent</h2>
<p><em>2011 - 2012</em></p>
<p>At <a href="//xn--r-5ma.si">Radio Študent</a>, I was the lead developer on the project of a major website overhaul. Since it was done mostly voluntarily, the process took over a year and posed many challenges. We needed to consider the workflow of over 150 active contributors, design a sensible structure for a large amount of daily produced content on various topics and implement custom functionalities to cover specifics of the working process.</p>
<p>On the technological side, we used Drupal 7 and a bunch of modules that allowed us to (among other things):</p>
<ul>
<li>present audio in different players (flash or native) depending on browser support</li>
<li>micro-manage content manipulation options based on users' roles in the editorial process</li>
<li>automate content creation from external software through REST API</li>
<li>implement complicated interconnected custom content-types</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fora d.o.o.</h2>
<p><em>2007 - 2011</em></p>
<p>Fora developed an entire IPTV platform called <a href="//fora.si">Perception</a>, of which I helped develop software that ran on set-top boxes for end-users. These devices ran a browser, so everything was created using standard front-web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS) and a sprinkle of proprietary APIs for stream-playing functionality. We developed a TV interface that was a large asynchronous one-page web application.</p>
