Some of the things I do for fun.

<hr>

## Kozjansko geekali≈°ƒçe

David ≈†arlah, a friend from primary school, reached out to me during the pandemic. I was kinda grumpy at first since I knew he was a recruiter and I thought he's just trying to hire me, but then we had a beer and decided to start a meetup.

That's how _Kozjansko geekali≈°ƒçe_ was born. We're a bunch of devs and other IT workers from [Kozjansko and Obsotelje](https://sl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kozjansko), we meet every first Friday of the month at 19:30 in [MC Slatna](https://mladinskislatna.si/mc-slatna/). There's a [website](https://geeki.zgajner.com) and [stickers](/geekalisce-stickers.jpg).


## Danes je nov dan

_Today is a new day_ is a collective of activists focused on increasing political participation, transparency and public oversight - often with the help of digital technology. I've been hanging around since ~2016, occasionally volunteering to develop bits and pieces of various projects (from [parliament tracking tools](https://parlameter.si/) to [battery chicken simulations](https://danesjenovdan.si/kura/)).

There's a lot to cover, so check out [the website](https://danesjenovdan.si/).

## Radio ≈†tudent

I passed the audition to become an announcer at this [infamous alternative station](https://sl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_%C5%A0tudent_Ljubljana) in 2010 and actively worked in that role for a few years. Some of my favorite contributions:

- [Kuharski programi](http://old.radiostudent.si/categories.php?catid=325) _(Culinary programmes, 2011)_ - We did four of these together with my friend and colleague Andra≈æ Magajna. The concept was to host a normal 4-hour live radio programme while cooking, each edition focused on a different culinary theme and included guests, cooking competitions and fake food-related news bits.
- [Dlakava Dlan](https://radiostudent.si/dru≈æba/dlakava-dlan) _(Hairy Palm, 2010 - 2015, __seriously NSFW__ üçÜ)_ - This morning feature ran weekly for 5 seasons  and covered different topics related to sexuality and pornography. It started as a joke, but grew immensely over the years. We somehow got a sex shop to sponsor us and did a bunch of fun things - from sex toy reviews and DVD giveaways to interviews and reports from local adult-themed events. Shoutout to Maco, ≈†u≈°ka, Tegla, Zala and Pia for their freaky contributions.
- [Pritiskavec](https://radiostudent.si/dru≈æba/pritiskavec) _(Joypad, 2015 - current)_ - Another morning feature with a simple concept - every week we recommend an indie video game. Originally the brainchild of Rasto Pahor, I was on board by the third week and Domen Mohoriƒç joined in the second season. The idea later (2017) spawned a more serious spinoff called [Pritiskavec Gold](https://radiostudent.si/kultura/pritiskavec-gold) - an hour-long monthly talk show where we cover various video game related topics. Both are still going strong.

If you speak Slovene, there are full recordings and podcast feeds of all of the above available on the provided links.

## Oktet 9

A small men's choir (well, an [a capella group](https://gph.is/1c3jSXd)) we've had since high-school. Not much to say other than they're some of my closest friends ‚ù§Ô∏è. We have [an outdated website](https://oktet9.com/) and [a release on Bandcamp](https://oktet9.bandcamp.com/releases) no one ever bought.
