title: Writing maintainable and extensible CSS (talk)
date: 2014-04-30

I prepared a short talk on writing maintainable and extensible CSS for the first [Ljubljana Webcamp](//webcamp.si). The event happened in april 2014, you can check out videos of [all the talks that were given](//video.webcamp.si/) or at least take a quick look at [mine](//video.webcamp.si/wc2014_zgajner_writing_maintainable_extensible_css/). It's about applying [OOCSS](//github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki)/[SMACSS](//smacss.com/) philosophies and using [Sass](//sass-lang.com/) with [Compass](//compass-style.org/) to make your code cleaner and easier to maintain and extend.

EDIT: Their website has since been taken down, so I dug up the [slides](/slides/Mato%20Å½gajner%20-%20Writing%20maintainable%20and%20extensible%20CSS.pdf) from my personal archive.
