I have been working with Vue quite a lot since the beginning of 2016, both at work and on personal projects. I have to say I'm quite excited about it - it's easy to understand and you can become very productive with it in a very short time, so I was happy to prepare a short talk about it for a [JavaScript meetup](//www.meetup.com/Ljubljana-JavaScript-User-Group/events/234612147/) in Ljubljana when the organizers invited me.

The talk was basically an overview of all the nice things you can get in the Vue.js ecosystem that aren't part of the core framework, but still mostly official and/or provided by the core team. Sadly, the talk wasn't recorded, but you can download the slides [here](/static/MakingSmallBigAgain.pdf).
